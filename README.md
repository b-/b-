[bri's blog](https://ibeep.com)

I write and contribute to open source software, especially related to networking, containerization, and virtualization.

I care a lot about giving back to the open source community by way of contributing, and my code has made it to some rather high-profile projects as a result. I have a small blog at [ibeep.com](https://ibeep.com), you can find me [on DN42](https://wiki.dn42.us/perchnet), and I'm easy to find on the [hackint](https://hackint.org/) IRC as `bri`.

Open to work. Formal résumé available upon request. _hi (at) ibeep.com_
