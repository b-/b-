### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently working on embedded device projects and firmware reverse engineering, and learning about [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) and Arm assembly language.

More specifically, I'm contributing to [Magic Lantern](https://magiclantern.fm) (with a focus on porting to the Canon M50 mirrorless digital camera), and I'm learning the Raspbian build system [pi-gen](https://github.com/rpi-distro/pi-gen). I am also experimenting with non-Raspberry Pi OS operating systems  on the Raspberry Pi, such as other Linux distributions and BSD variants.

If you are interested in building cool embedded projects or Linux systems, reach out to me! I enjoy solving problems.

I'm most easily reachable via [Keybase: https://keybase.io/bri_](https://keybase.com/bri_)

Formal rÃ©sumÃ© available upon request.

<!-- who knew Github was trying to become a social network? This is weird. Is it a resume? A profile? What *is* this? -->
