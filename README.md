### _bri_, open sourceror.

I'm currently doing a lot of work with open source software, especially in networking and virtualization. I care a lot about giving back to the open source community by way of contributing, and my code has made it to some rather high-profile projects as a result. You can find me [on DN42](https://wiki.dn42.us/perchnet), and I'm easy to find on the [hackint](https://hackint.org/) IRC as `bri`.
