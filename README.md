### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on embedded Linux projects, namely [HOOBS](https://github.com/hoobs-org/hoobs-build). I'm learning the Raspbian build system [pi-gen](https://github.com/rpi-distro/pi-gen) as well as experimenting with non-Raspbian Linux distributions on the Raspberry Pi.

If you are interested in building cool embedded projects, or you have something in mind, reach out to me! I enjoy solving problems.

I'm most easily reachable via Keybase: https://keybase.io/bri_
<!-- who knew Github was trying to become a social network? This is weird. Is it a resume? A profile? What *is* this? -->
